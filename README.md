This assignment is asking you to create a Python interpreter for a simple language called "Little." The Little language has a defined syntax represented in BNF (Backus-Naur Form), and it supports positive integers and eight operations: double, triple, square, cube, add, sub, mult, and div. Your program should read from an input file, process each line, and produce the correct output for each line. The output can be written to the Python Shell window.

Here are the main requirements for your program:

Prompt for an input file name.
Process each line in the file and generate the corresponding output.
Ignore lines containing only white space or beginning with a comment (lines starting with #).
Print the line (minus the newline character) followed by the value produced by executing the line. This value could be an error message.
You should use the provided outline as a starting point, but you will need to modify and extend it to implement the required functionality. The outline includes some functions that need modification, and you should look at the comments and update the code accordingly.

Additionally, the assignment asks you to write a short paragraph explaining why your program is easier than a true compiler. In your explanation, you should highlight at least three things you didn't need to implement that a full compiler would require.

To successfully complete the assignment, follow an incremental development approach, test your code frequently, and consider using comments (denoted by #) in your Little language test file to isolate and debug issues as they arise. Ensure that your program produces the correct output based on the provided test file (TestAll.little).

In summary, you are building a simple interpreter for the Little language, and your program should be able to process Little code from an input file and produce the expected output as described in the assignment instructions.
